Even in political spaces, when we're trying to solve international conflicts, if the first step isn't being kind, it's not going to be successful at all.\n\nWe recently had a seminar where this amazing speaker, Mary Brown, came in and gave a speech about love and its importance. It’s been great learning about that. One of my professors hosted a seminar to celebrate the Good Friday Agreement, which was one of the agreements that ended the troubles in Northern Ireland. One of the signers was there and 25 years ago when all the conflict was happening, she led the women's Coalition for Northern Ireland and was able to be a huge part in starting the conversations and eventually signing the peace agreement. Hearing her speak and hearing her knowledge and wisdom was super interesting. She also talked about the importance of being kind and caring and thinking about humans first.\n";
