Kids flocked to that school because it was likely to feed them into an ivy.The people at this school were also very competitive and it was all in your face because you live there, so you really couldn't escape that environment. At times it could be really mentally destructive. \n\nI started accepting that I have my own path and even if it seems like other people are doing more meaningful things or finding more success, it's not black and white. Your story is not going to look exactly like their story. But I think that's so tough, especially when you're younger and you don't know all the possibilities that life has to offer.\n\nBut in college, there's just so much to explore. It’s cliche, but the world really is like your oyster. Because of my mindset, I worry less about doing a bunch of things at once. You don't need to be amazing at 10 things. The world is broad enough and interesting enough that one thing that you're curious about will take you somewhere exciting. If you have an interest, there will be a community out there. I feel like I have to give myself that advice. Sometimes I juggle a lot because there are a lot of things that excite me. But I’m trying to figure out what I enjoy most.\n";
