There's so much hate in the world because people don't understand the things people go through. You just have to have more empathy with everyone's struggles and everyone's stories.\n\nI'm nonbinary and a lot of people seem to want to take my rights and identity away. But it's because they don't understand what I have to go through and everything I have lived and will continue to live every single day.\n\nIn this part of the US, it's pretty ok, but in a lot of different parts, especially Florida, they seem to want to erase our history and ignore us completely, which is not how life should be lived.";
