If you dwell on perfection, you're not going to gain a lot out of it. All we can really ask ourselves is to improve. Even if, instead of getting an A I got an A minus, asking, “Did I improve? Did I meet some new people?” That's more important than perfection.\n\nI don't know if I am a perfectionist per se, but I still struggle with it. I have very high standards for myself. If I don't meet something or get a bad grade, especially if it's a subject that I feel like I should know a lot about, I feel disheartened. I feel a lot of anxiety like it’s the end of the world. I've definitely had to change my mindset from wanting perfection to improvement, to be ok with a grade I get, and to make the most out of my time at BU. \n";
