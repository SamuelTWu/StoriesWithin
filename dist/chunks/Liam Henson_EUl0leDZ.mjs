In college, I'm not put down for not being smart. I'm allowed to make mistakes and I am surrounded by friends who make me feel like I can show them my weaknesses and flaws. \nI am a lot more confident, whereas before I was met with scolding and bad remarks. Here, it's like we're all human, we're not perfect, we make mistakes and I have friends who have faith in me. \n\nThroughout high school, I didnâ€™t really think about who I was. I guess I'm proud of my identity but I don't wear it on my chest or anything. I'm half Asian; I have a Chinese mom. After the divorce, it was just me and her. During the Asian hate period, I was reminded that I'm half Chinese, and my mom is Chinese. It was like a reminder of who we are, and where we come from.\n\nI remember in spring 2021, there were hate crimes going on in SF. I told my mom, please be careful when you go out or stay indoors. I wasn't too worried because she never got hurt, thank God, it was always a little stressful to know that my people were being attacked. I was like, oh shit, my mom is Chinese. I'm half-Chinese. I have to be worried about that now. \n";
