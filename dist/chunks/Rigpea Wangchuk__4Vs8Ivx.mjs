Every night I could have gone out. But the thing is I stayed in. So my first year I focused on academics a lot\n\nThe thing that caused the change was office hours. I just went, even if I had no work to do, and I just sat there and I started talking to a lot of people. I would approach people and say “Oh, hi. Hello. How’s that going?” My trick was to remember just one small thing that they did yesterday. I guess in that way I grew some sort of attachment and started forming friendships. That’s how I met a lot of the CS friends I made right now. \n\nI want to know other people’s personalities. I want to see what these characters are like in real life as well and hear about their stories and what they have been through. And it’s not like I started off like, oh shit, everybody talk, talk, talk. No. It started off with me going to one person and hearing and then slowly working it out. I got a job in orientation over the summer and I opened up a lot. It’s a place where you talk about so many aspects of your personal life which is not done back in India. But over here, you really see your own personalities, and in a way, your personality is also shaped in regards to what you see. \n\n";
