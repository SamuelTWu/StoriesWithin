Like, they probably wouldn't like me as much, or the guys at least. I don't know about the girls. I feel like girls just don't give a fuck anywhere except my mom. But one of the girls at the Japanese International School, she asked me on the last day. She was like, are you gay?\n\nAnd then she literally told me in her broken English, she had to like, look it up and she was just like, are you gay? I was like, yes. Then she was like, me too! So she had a girlfriend back at home in Japan and her parents know about it and like I asked her all about this.\n\nI was lowkey in shock that she could have that parentsâ€™ support back in the non-progressive country. Meanwhile, my mother is in a progressive country and is the complete opposite.\n";
