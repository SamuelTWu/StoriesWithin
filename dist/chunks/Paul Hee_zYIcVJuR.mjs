I have to say that's probably my biggest struggle transitioning from high school to college. I went through high school as, like, top of my class honor roll. I recognize now the level of education really screwed me over. Because I never struggled in high school. And that honestly screwed me over going to BU because then I really learned what truly difficult classes are.\n\nIn sophomore year, I finally went to a psychologist. I got diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. I was like, fuck. \n\nBut I discovered all that my sophomore year and I ended up being put on medication. It changed everything. I was just like, dang, it's easier to read a book now. It was easier to watch a lecture without fidgeting. Like, I realized how bad my stressors were just to focus in class. You would see my foot bouncing. I needed to move. I needed to get up. The biggest thing is I would scratch my head, but I used to do it till it bled, that's how bad it was. And I never recognized that as an issue. It's not like they don't exist back home. It's that no one knows about them.\n\n\n";
