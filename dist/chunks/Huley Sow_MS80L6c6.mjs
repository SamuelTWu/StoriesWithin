Like, I felt like it was for myself and I was enjoying it, but at some point it felt like everything I was doing was for my parents. I was making them proud. It was less about what makes me happy. \n\nI came in as Pre-Med / Biology. It was something I wanted to do since forever. But at some point in high school, I was like, I don't want to go to med school. I expressed that to my parents, and they were like, no. They're just like, no. What are you gonna do? I was like, I want to be a midwife. And they were like, no, why would you be a midwife? Like a nurse or whatever? You could be a doctor! And I was like, I guess that makes sense.\n\nI got to college and started to do the actual coursework and realized I didn't have enough drive to do this. It's just annoying and disappointing. I had to grapple with my identity and what I wanted to do for a living. Which is hard. \n\nI'm still in medicine, but it’s not pre-med. It’s still true that I always wanted to be a medicine, but I didn't want to do it on that path. I realize that I'm my own person and I'm here to do something for my own life. \n";
