That was one of my favorite movies growing up. I kind of follow this mantra where it's saying that life isn't worth living if you're not happy.\n\nWhen I try something out, I ask myself, “Is my heart really into this?” And if it's not, I should do my best to get away from it if I can. But most of the time I try to do things I love.\n";
