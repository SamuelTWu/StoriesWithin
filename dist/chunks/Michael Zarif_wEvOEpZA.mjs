A lot of times you just focus on the bad parts of things that happen, but there's always a good side. \n\nOne time in my senior year of high school, I had a bad event with my mom having cancer. It was during my college admission process. My mom got colon cancer. Nothing like that has ever happened to me before. I realized that these things can actually happen. So I realized to always be thankful for what you have at the moment because you never know what could happen.\n";
