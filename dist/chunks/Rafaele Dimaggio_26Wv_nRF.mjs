In New York, you can get anywhere in like 30 minutes, which is pretty awesome.\n\nI think Boston is on a legacy system from like 302 years ago. That's what really kills it. New York, I don't know, it has more money and the streets aren't lined up so horribly. I heard someone say that Boston has half the amount of miles of track, but they have double the amount of workers. So they're not really doing good from a business standpoint. \n";
