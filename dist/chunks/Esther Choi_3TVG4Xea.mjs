They were very strict. They cared a lot about grades and church. So basically all I did in high school was try to get good grades and go to church\nWhen I got to college, I got to grow into who I am. I became a little more extroverted, more of a go-getter. I tried to do things that I wanted to do rather than m what my parents wanted. \n\nWhen you're in a strict household, it's really hard to do what you enjoy and to have fun. I think that in college you should just try to have as much fun as possible. Some people might disagree with that. But I think you should really figure out what you like and it's hard to do that when you're in a strict house. My advice to those who left a strict house in college is to just have fun and enjoy your life. You know, it's *your* life.\n\n";
