Our generation is so smart and so brilliant, but we forget how to forgive and we forget how to give second chances. In a harsh world where we all want to succeed and see change, we also have to be changed. And be understanding and realize we're all young and we all make mistakes. \n\nI someday want to be in the media as a journalist and as an activist, but I’ve still made a lot of mistakes in my life. Sometimes I’ve failed to do all the research or said something that wasn’t well-informed and didn’t sit right. But for me, I'm so lucky that I still get to change. Because I had people who were able to forgive me and I was also able to acknowledge my mistakes and be forgiven. Everyone in life deserves that.\n";
