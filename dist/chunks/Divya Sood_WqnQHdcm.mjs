In middle school, I used to watch a lot of YouTubers and wanted to be that person. So I just started a blog in quarantine and I wrote one post. \n\nThat’s where it started. I wrote a couple of posts. I wrote a reflection post about the transition to college from the COVID-19 perspective in November. So it was a lot of reflecting on my experiences. \nI think that especially for reflec\ntion-oriented posts where it’s very organic, like, I’m not creating content - I’m not like a business with a blog trying to create content to push customers. It’s just something that I felt like doing. I think it’s important for me to have that space to live my life and get those reflections as opposed to letting the content creation drive me.\n\n\n";
