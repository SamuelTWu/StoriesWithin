It helps me perform well on my own academically. It helped me make the most out of the connections and making friendships.\n\nThere have been times I haven't done so well in a course or studied as well for an exam, but over time that happened less and less because I'm just getting to know how I study best, and how I work best. It's definitely been a journey. But, yeah, it keeps on going.\n";
