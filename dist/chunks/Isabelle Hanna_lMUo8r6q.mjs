I was very much this is right and everything else is wrong. I didn't deal well with disagreements. I mean, there are obviously some things that I won't compromise on. If someone's like, women suck, that’s one thing, but in terms of political beliefs, I don't cancel anybody immediately that disagrees with me. I'm able to have more conversations about it.\n\nSo I definitely noticed some personal growth in not canceling people. I used to love canceling people honestly. I remember the first week of freshman year I was talking to someone and she said she didn't hate all police and I was like “ You don't hate all the police? Yeah, you're canceled. Like, fuck 12.” So I've gotten a little bit more chill. There have been times I’ve made friends not knowing their beliefs and realizing that they're very kind and then learning that they have a different belief and realizing that doesn't invalidate everything else that I already believe about them. \n\nI guess and there obviously are still some things that I’m passionate about. If I meet someone and they're like, “I love Donald Trump”, I'm not gonna be fine with that. But at least compromising on some things.\n\n\n";
