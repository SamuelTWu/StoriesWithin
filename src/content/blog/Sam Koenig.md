Take care of your personal hygiene. First impressions are so important. If you come well presented then you know that you're gonna leave a positive first impression. 

I brush my teeth and shower every morning. I make sure I’m well dressed, you know, take some extra time to put together a little outfit. Make sure I’m smelling good, you know, have some deodorant or cologne. And make sure I’m well manicured too.
