Boston needs more fun little sightseeing things like little swings and stuff. If there were a swing right here, by these blue bikes, that would be sick like a little tire swing. 

It just makes life fun. I could get a little burger at the George Sherman Union and sit on the little swing. It would make me feel like a kid and it's good for adults.
