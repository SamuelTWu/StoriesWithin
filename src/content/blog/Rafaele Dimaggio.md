Boston Transit sucks. It takes you about an hour to get anywhere and the T is about walking speed. In New York, you can get anywhere in like 30 minutes, which is pretty awesome.

I think Boston is on a legacy system from like 302 years ago. That's what really kills it. New York, I don't know, it has more money and the streets aren't lined up so horribly. I heard someone say that Boston has half the amount of miles of track, but they have double the amount of workers. So they're not really doing good from a business standpoint.
