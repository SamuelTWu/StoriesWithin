# Safiya Karim

![local image](../../assets/Safiya_Karim.JPG)
I grew up sitting in on my mom's lectures. She's a business strategy professor. Ever since I was little, I've been sitting in her classes just listening to business lectures and I thought it was really interesting. And so one day I looked at her and I was like, that's what I want to do.

I think that the world is too focused on picking sides to things instead of supporting each other. My major is marketing and finance. In the future, I hope to make the finance industry more peaceful and equal, especially since there are a lot of finance bro types.  I just wish it was less aggressive because I know the business world is very competitive.
