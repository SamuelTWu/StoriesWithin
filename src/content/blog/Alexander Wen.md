# Alexander Wen

![local image](../../assets/Alexander_Wen.JPG)
I think we all have to be a little bit nicer to each other. There's just too much hate and negativity in the world right now. And I think a little bit of positivity would do a lot better for the world.

I know growing up, I've been surrounded by a lot of negativity. Instead of perpetuating something like that, I would want to be a bigger person and do better for myself and other people. Being positive and bringing joy and happiness to the world is one step in my process of doing that.
