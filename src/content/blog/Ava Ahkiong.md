I feel like the world would be a lot better if we considered each other's emotions and tried to understand what we are all going through mutually. It takes empathy. 

To me, empathy is just investing time into asking me how I feel. A less self-centered kind of conversation. Itâ€™s putting the effort into understanding what someone is trying to communicate to you and what they need from you, and then taking that and cultivating and manifesting it.
