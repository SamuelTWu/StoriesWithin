# Yuki Frampton

![local image](../../assets/Yuki_Frampton.JPG)
I've always known what I wanted to do. I've always been very adamant about being a music teacher. But now, being older and going through some good and bad music experiences, a lot has changed. Even so, Iâ€™ve seen great music teachers who have such care and respect for their students that's reciprocated, and that inspired me to keep going.
