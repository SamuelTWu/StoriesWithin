Music is intuitive and it's in touch with something greater than ourselves. Itâ€™s kind of spiritual, which makes me feel small, you know what I mean? In a good way.

I am a first-year Doctoral of Musical Arts, so I play experimental avant-garde stuff. I'll ask an audience to pick a color and an adjective and play what I think that sounds like. So like A is red, but it's also like a texture thing. Some notes are pointy and some are like velvety.
