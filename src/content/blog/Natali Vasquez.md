Live in the world! Get some sleep, do what you want, smoke some weed if you need to, drink if you need to, and have fun making mistakes. Don't be hard on yourself because that's when life gets better.

Last semester I was struggling so much. I got decent grades, but I was so stressed all the time. Crying all the time. But this semester I actually sleep and I actually worked out and I'm going out and my grades are even better.
