# Leensyn Rivera

I would say just Free Palestine to the entire city of Boston, the entire world if I could!

I'm just thinking about what's going on in Israel and Palestine. I don't know why it's so immediate to me right now. I guess it's a hot topic. I'm not from the area. I don't have any personal ties either. I just kind of feel strongly about it and a lot of other people do too. I don't know.

I thought the protests were great. I'm a transfer so I never really saw students doing things that. My old school was really small. I didn't see things like that until I got here and I was like, that's interesting. It's nice to see because it's history, you know what I mean? I like that. It's a bunch of people who are so genuinely passionate or feel so strongly about something that they're willing to walk out even when it's really cold outside and spread the word and show love and support. I appreciate that a lot.
