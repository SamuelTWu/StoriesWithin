# Alex Shores

![local image](/../src/assets/Alex_Shores.JPG)

I'm first gen. Like, my dad went to a semester at a music school in Berkeley and my mom did like a couple of semesters at a community college. They never got a degree. So neither of them had the experience and most of my relatives didn't go to college, so I never really knew what to expect.
My dad very much encouraged me to only think about my career, only do things in college that would benefit my career. But then to realize that you're a person and there's so much more to you than that and to like, just explore those things. 

I looked up film clubs at bu and there aren't too many and I looked up and I was like, I'm not a big frat person, but I was like, you know, I'm gonna give it a shot. My sophomore year I had a leadership from the club. I got more involved. We had like in-person events, we got to actually meet people and it was just like, it was one of my favorite events that year. I got involved in the production that year. 

It was my first time actually honestly being on film sets because it was just hard to find anything at that time. And so it's just the best experience being on a film set for the first time, with all these people who also care about films and want to see it succeed. And just seeing how a set looks.
