In high school, it was all AP classes. Getting to the top. And then I went to college and I realized that I wanted to go into film and share other people's stories. Coming from a Hispanic family, that was not what they wanted. They wanted me to go into pre-med. Now I got here and I'm doing an internship for Disney. But I never would have done it if I had just stuck to what everyone wanted me to do. I've kind of branched out and done what makes me happiest. I can't even imagine what would have happened if I had just been a doctor.

So spend more time doing what makes you happy. I spent so long doing what others expected of me and not what I thought would truly make me the happiest. And now that I've realized that I can do whatever I want and go out and do all the things that I've wanted to do. Seeing all my friends doing the same thing and striving to do what makes them the most happy above anything else just makes me happier.
