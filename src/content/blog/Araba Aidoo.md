# Araba Aidoo

![local image](../../assets/Araba_Aidoo.JPG)

Live off campus. I haven't lived in Stuvi or Myles, but I just feel life is better off-campus. I'm so tired of living on campus. I've lived in Fenway and Towers and I've had traumatic experiences in both. And I miss having my own kitchen. I miss having my own space and I feel like that contributes a lot to your mental health. So I would say live off campus if you can.
