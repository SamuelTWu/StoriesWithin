# Cheryl Lai

I think that we all need to be louder about the things that we're passionate about. As college students, a lot of us are working our way around our lives centered around other people. I think if you have something that you genuinely believe in and genuinely enjoy, you should be louder about that.

A lot of the people I know tiptoe around each other a little bit. That's what it's like when you are still trying to figure yourself out. But I think if you have something you really, really believe in, everyone should know.
