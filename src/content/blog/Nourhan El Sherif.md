# Nourhan El Sherif

![local image](/../src/assets/Nourhan_El_Sherif.JPG)

In high school, I was super into fashion. My priority was to experience all the different styles. I went through an anime phase. I went to a convention. It was, like, pretty embarrassing. I had a whole collection of Hot Topic shirts. That ended my sophomore year of high school. My mom went on a pilgrimage to Mecca near my junior year. When she came back, it was a whole transformation for her. And since she was always my role model, when she became more religious, it kind of guided me to be more religious as well. I started taking modesty more seriously. That was a big deal. 

My religious phase extended into college. I joined the Islamic Society of BU and became really involved. I met a bunch of my really close friends there. They also helped guide me into being more religious and now I wear the hijab. So it's kind of a full circle. 

My freshman year it was COVID so all the events were outdoors. It was a pretty small community because not a lot of people were on campus. Now, we have 400 people at the big events, so it's a huge difference. My freshman year, because it was a smaller community, it helped me get to know everybody and get more involved. The president of my first year was super welcoming and made me feel like I really had brothers and sisters here. It was very homey and it encouraged me to continue being involved. 

I feel like BU is pretty accommodating in a lot of ways, but there's definitely a lot of room for improvement. Weâ€™ve met with the dean of students and different people from faculty and staff to help with dining hall improvements, getting prayer rugs, getting a bigger space for Ramadan, and everything like that. So far they're really good about trying to work with us. We definitely have complaints, but I'm very thankful that they're trying.
