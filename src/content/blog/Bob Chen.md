# Bob Chen

![local image](/../src/assets/Bob_Chen.JPG)

In high school was more introverted. I grew up in China and I was adjusting to American high school. I lived with a host family in high school. After class, I would spend a lot of time with them, so not much with my classmates.

I changed a bunch of host families. My first host family was not good at English and we had a lot of conflicts. After two months, I had to move to a new host family and then during high school, I changed four different ones because of different reasons. One of my favorite host families was Jamaican. They were really nice and treated me really well. They would make me Jamaican food. But all the American families would just make lasagna.
