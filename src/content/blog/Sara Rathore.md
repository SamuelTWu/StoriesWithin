# Sara Rathore

![local image](../../assets/Sara_Rathore.JPG)

I really like understanding how our brains work. Whenever I’m doing something, I about the processes in my brain that allow me to do it. I don't think people understand how amazing the human brain is until they’ve actually learned about it. And there's just so much that needs to be discovered about the brain too. Like, why do we sleep? Why do we dream? Like all these things are unknown?
