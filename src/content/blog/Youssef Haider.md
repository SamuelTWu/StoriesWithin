# Youssef Haider

![local image](/../src/assets/Youssef_Haider.JPG)

I always remind myself that my family was sacrificing a lot financially and emotionally to bring me here, thousands of miles away from them, to further my education. It helps me perform well on my own academically. It helped me make the most out of the connections and making friendships.

There have been times I haven't done so well in a course or studied as well for an exam, but over time that happened less and less because I'm just getting to know how I study best, and how I work best. It's definitely been a journey. But, yeah, it keeps on going.
