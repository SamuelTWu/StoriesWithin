# Selah Youn

![local image](../../assets/Selah_Youn.JPG)

I was an English minor and then I became an English major after much deliberation. My relationship with my parents is tumultuous. Definitely. They always wanted me to go to Med School. Don’t get me wrong, I still like bio. But recognized that even through high school really enjoyed my English classes. I was always a big reader. I like to write. To my parents, it was just an extra thing that I'm passionate about. And I think that I'm good enough at bio to major in it.

I realized I'm gonna be doing whatever I major in for the rest of my life. A lot of people say if you're gonna change majors, do it during undergrad. If you realize your passions later in life, you're stuck at this dead-end job. 

I realized I'd be doing a disservice to my patients and myself if put myself through all that emotional and physical stress. And money. So I had to really dig deep and think about what I actually wanted to do. I can't just go by what my parents have been kind of pushing me towards. Not saying that I didn't want to, I just had to choose between two. 

I’ve started recognizing that fulfillment is more important than money. I don't want to wake up every single day and be like, damn, I have to go back to my job, you know what I mean? On top of that, I knew what I wanted to do with my English major. So I didn’t go into it blindly. That's the only thing that convinced my parents. They were like, you can switch, but those conversations were long and hard. But in the end, I had to be like, it's not your life, is it?
