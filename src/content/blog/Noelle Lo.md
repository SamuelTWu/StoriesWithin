# Noelle Lo

![local image](../../assets/Noelle_Lo.JPG)

Be kinder and forgive more. Our generation is so smart and so brilliant, but we forget how to forgive and we forget how to give second chances. In a harsh world where we all want to succeed and see change, we also have to be changed. And be understanding and realize we're all young and we all make mistakes. 

I someday want to be in the media as a journalist and as an activist, but I’ve still made a lot of mistakes in my life. Sometimes I’ve failed to do all the research or said something that wasn’t well-informed and didn’t sit right. But for me, I'm so lucky that I still get to change. Because I had people who were able to forgive me and I was also able to acknowledge my mistakes and be forgiven. Everyone in life deserves that.
