# Xingda Li

![local image](../../assets/Xingda_Li.JPG)

From what I've heard from the West Coast, people in New England are a bit rude or condescending.

*Do you feel like that's the case in your experience?*

Not really. I think people are just acting calmly. They don't laugh very fake with fake laughs or something.
