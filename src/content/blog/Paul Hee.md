# Paul Hee

![local image](../../assets/Paul_Hee.JPG)

I realized, holy crap, school is no longer a joke anymore. I have to say that's probably my biggest struggle transitioning from high school to college. I went through high school as, like, top of my class honor roll. I recognize now the level of education really screwed me over. Because I never struggled in high school. And that honestly screwed me over going to BU because then I really learned what truly difficult classes are.

In sophomore year, I finally went to a psychologist. I got diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. I was like, fuck. 

But I discovered all that my sophomore year and I ended up being put on medication. It changed everything. I was just like, dang, it's easier to read a book now. It was easier to watch a lecture without fidgeting. Like, I realized how bad my stressors were just to focus in class. You would see my foot bouncing. I needed to move. I needed to get up. The biggest thing is I would scratch my head, but I used to do it till it bled, that's how bad it was. And I never recognized that as an issue. It's not like they don't exist back home. It's that no one knows about them.
