# Logan Lechuga

![local image](../../assets/Logan_Lechuga.JPG)

I saw a guy playing a piano in the GSU the other day and I just had to stop by and tell him he had an amazing voice and that he was really gifted. 

I just feel like, given the situation the world has been in the past couple of years, everyone needs to love each other more and show appreciation for one another. Just lend a hand whenever a hand is needed.
