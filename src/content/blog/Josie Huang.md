# Josie Huang

A lot of people don't prioritize what they eat. And they don't see the effects of it on their everyday life and it just kind of compounds. But eating healthy is like an automatic life upgrader.

I feel like Iâ€™m saying this because me right now is pretty different from me just a couple of years ago. Before there was a lot of not sleeping a lot, eating unhealthy, and not choosing my circle wisely. But just make sure there's a balance in every day.
