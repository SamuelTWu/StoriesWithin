# Divya Sood

![local image](../../assets/Divya_Sood.JPG)

I have always liked to write and talk about my experiences from the lens of reflecting on them. In middle school, I used to watch a lot of YouTubers and wanted to be that person. So I just started a blog in quarantine and I wrote one post. 

That’s where it started. I wrote a couple of posts. I wrote a reflection post about the transition to college from the COVID-19 perspective in November. So it was a lot of reflecting on my experiences. 
I think that especially for reflec
tion-oriented posts where it’s very organic, like, I’m not creating content - I’m not like a business with a blog trying to create content to push customers. It’s just something that I felt like doing. I think it’s important for me to have that space to live my life and get those reflections as opposed to letting the content creation drive me.
