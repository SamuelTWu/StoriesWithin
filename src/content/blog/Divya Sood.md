# Divya Sood

![local image](/../src/assets/Divya_Sood.JPG)

I have always liked to write and talk about my experiences from the lens of reflecting on them. When I was younger, like in middle school, I used to watch a lot of YouTubers and like, wanted to be that person. So I just like, started a blog in quarantine and I wrote one post, like an introductory post.
So that's kind of where it started. I wrote a couple of posts. I wrote a reflection post about the transition to college from the COVID-19 perspective in November. So it was a lot of like, just like reflecting on my experiences. 

I think that especially for reflection-oriented posts where it's very organic, like, I'm not creating content - I'm not like a business with a blog trying to create content to push customers. I'm just like, OK, that's something that I kind of felt like I was doing. I think it's important for me to have that space to like, live my life, and get those reflections as opposed to letting the content creation drive me.
