# Rigpea Wangchuk

![local image](../../assets/Rigpea_Wangchuk.JPG)

I started off as a shy kid. My first semester I barely talked to people. I was a shut-in. Every night I could have gone out. But the thing is I stayed in. So my first year I focused on academics a lot

The thing that caused the change was office hours. I just went, even if I had no work to do, and I just sat there and I started talking to a lot of people. I would approach people and say "Oh, hi. Hello. How's that going?" My trick was to remember just one small thing that they did yesterday. I guess in that way I grew some sort of attachment and started forming friendships. That's how I met a lot of the CS friends I made right now. 

I want to know other people's personalities. I want to see what these characters are like in real life as well and hear about their stories and what they have been through. And it's not like I started off like, oh shit, everybody talk, talk, talk. No. It started off with me going to one person and hearing and then slowly working it out. This job that I got for the summer, in orientation, I think I opened up a lot during this time also. Itâ€™s a place where you talk about so many aspects of your personal life which is not done back in India. But over here, you really see your own personalities, and in a way, your personality is also shaped in regards to what you see.
