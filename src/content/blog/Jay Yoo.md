Having an end is what gives meaning to everything.

Because people forget to cherish what we have. You always regret it after you lose it.

My dad passed away when I was in high school. I just never had the chance to thank him ever. And I've lost my chance to. 

Don't hold back on saying sorry, thank you, and I love you.
