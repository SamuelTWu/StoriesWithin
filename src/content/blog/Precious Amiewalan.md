# Precious Amiewalan

![local image](../../assets/Precious_Amiewalan.JPG)

I was born in Nigeria and my parents and us moved here when I was around seven or so. My mom owns two businesses so I would help her a lot as a kid for the salon.  So I think I was just into saving at like, the age of 12 or, yeah.

I don't stay in things for too long. I think it was probably like the ADHD. My parents just thought I was bored. I would do random things. I was in ballet for a year. Violin, gave up on that. Yeah, it was just alternating between those. Finally, I was like, you know what, my heart lies with the money.

And so I would do full business. I'd watch business videos to improve my mom's business because I was like, if she's richer that means I'm richer. She would say that to me too. It'd be like a trade-off. She would do my hair for hours at a time I'd be on the laptop trying to be like, Mom, what's your login? Let's do these like tax forms now. Or I'd take a break to read. And since I was the youngest I knew more about the internet than my brothers did. So they would come to me for that or I would teach them like citizenship things and quiz them on that. My dad was doing like, I think an associate degree when I was younger too. So I would quiz him and I would quiz my mom. So yeah, I would be the one that did it for them.
