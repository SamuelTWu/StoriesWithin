The high school that I went to was like really competitive and it felt like everyone was just so smart and everyone's parents were so successful. It was like a lot of pressure to do well in school and do sports and all this stuff. So in high school, when I was a freshman, I was friends with these girls that I had gone to middle and elementary school with and they were really put together and perfect. That played a role in feeling pressure all the time to be perfect. 

I kind of left those girls and became friends with some different people who were not as perfect. A little more relaxed. Being around them made me relax a more and not be so stressed about school. I didn't do as well in school when I was friends with them, but I was a lot more relaxed.
