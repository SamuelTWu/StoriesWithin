# Abdul Malik

![local image](../../assets/Abdul_Malik.JPG)

The world must embrace love. We should love each other because if we love each other, I believe the world will be peaceful. There will be no anger, there will be no hatred, there will be no sickness at all.

I believe everything is based on love. Your parents are giving back by sending you to college. If you get married to your spouse, whatever you want to do, if there is love, it will go pretty smoothly. I'm passionate about helping humanity. I believe if someone like me grows to become a business leader, I'll be able to make an impact in the world.
