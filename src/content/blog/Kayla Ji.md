# Kayla Ji

![local image](../../assets/Kayla_Ji.JPG)

In high school, I literally thought there was something wrong with me because I couldn't pay attention. My mom would be like, oh, if you just pay attention in class, it will be easy for you on the test.

I was like, no, I can't. I don't know why I can't. Then my sister was diagnosed with AHDH in January or December. She was like, oh, yeah, you should probably get tested too because it's a genetic thing. I think my dad has it. Itâ€™s like such a weird feeling to get diagnosed with something because for a while I was like, ain't no way. Like you look at other people within that community and you kind of are like, oh, I don't do that. Like, I don't do that, like, ok, I probably don't have it. I'm probably being dramatic and stuff. Then slowly over time, I was like, maybe I should try what other people with ADHD do and I was like wow, that's so much easier. And so I was like ok, maybe I do have something. 

I mean, I think it made sense. As a kid, my sister would tell my mom, I think Kayla has ADHD and my mom would be like, no. Because in Korean culture it's not as talked about.

Like, it's not that big of a deal. And I guess it explained my behavior a lot more. I feel like I can't blame everything on my ADHD but I feel like I'm able to be less strict on myself. Because I've always been pretty harsh on myself. So that's really cool.
