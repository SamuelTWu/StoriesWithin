# Kristi Li

![local image](../../assets/Kristi_Li.JPG)

The lifestyle here is way faster. I feel like I always need to be working on something. I started planning, like with a planner, after I came to college. I didn't do that in high school. I just look at my planner and I want to fill out every single box. If I don't, I feel like I'm slacking. It feels like everybody is doing the same thing. You get that invisible peer pressure. 

But Iâ€™ve been trying not to stress as much and explore. This world is too polarizing in a lot of aspects, whether it's politics or ideologies. I'm the type of person who wants to welcome all thoughts. That's why I think exposure is really important. You don't necessarily have to agree with another person, but I think it's important to be a good listener and just be exposed to ideas different from your own. Coming into college, the first thing I did was join JSA. Even though I don't have any family members who are Japanese, Japan is a very important place to me. I wanted to expose myself to the culture more. And I was really proud of myself for attending their first general meeting! I remember it clearly: it was September before COVID, and I went there by myself. I have always been a very shy person, but I started talking to strangers and then ended up in e-board that semester! I was still very proud of myself because I stepped out of my comfort zone and made a lot of Japanese friends.
