Be more in the present and stop living in the past or worrying about the future. Just enjoy the moments of today.

A lot of people are living in past trauma or worrying about the mistakes they made in the past or thinking about the future and the fact that “I want to do this, I want to do that” and then missing what they're doing today.

I'm a college student, so I think about how I could have done this or that. I should have done this more for grades or personal experience. And then I kind of miss out on what I'm learning and I forget to enjoy the material. I’m pre-med, so I constantly think about being a good applicant and sometimes I forget to enjoy things. I am a college student. I should be enjoying these days.
