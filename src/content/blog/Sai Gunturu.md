I was way more insecure about myself in high school. I wasn't comfortable being in my own skin. So I would try to act more like confident, you know, instead of actually being confident, and more like putting on a show. I'd use academic achievement as self-worth in high school. Like, the only way I was getting confidence was if I got good grades. I had a fragile ego and stuff like that. 

I love my friends back there but like, I think I didn't have a great community. So, once I came here and actually had friends that were nice to each other and putting each other up, kind of thing, it was more nice. We’d say nice things about each other.

And like, I've seen those changes when my friends go to college, you know, we go back now, we're more nice. I think it might be an age thing. I don't think it's even like the culture. Like, I don't know what it is but we've all gone to a place where we can say, like, you look better now. I think it’s definitely the social scene, but also a lot of self-introspection and actually understanding why we do things.
